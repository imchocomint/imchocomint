## About me
I'm imchocomint, or leg1on if you have been watching my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6iD1OYmXHfuWubG4O1_W1w) or visited my [Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/IESXleg1on) before. IRL, my name is Minh. I'm a high school student in Hanoi, Vietnam who like making things. I'm single. I learned programming on my own.

## What I'm (actively) cooking
- [ZaloAlt](https://github.com/imchocomint/ZaloAlt), an alternative client for [Zalo desktop Windows](https://zalo.me/pc) and [its macOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalo/id579523206) (the link is for iOS, sorry for the inconvenience)
- [meowniverse studio](https://github.com/meowniverse), my other account for large projects.
- and so on

I edit with neovim and VS Code, and use both of them equally (VS Code for any language rather than Go, Python or Ruby; neovim for the rest)
